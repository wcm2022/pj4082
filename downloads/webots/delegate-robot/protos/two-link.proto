# Planar two-link actuated arm for course exercises.  The graphics use only
# primitives for clarity of the source. The base has NULL physics so it will be
# fixed in place. The two link lengths are adjustable parameters to demonstrate
# using procedural elements in the prototype.  The link physics properties are
# specified using density so the dynamics will also scale, but the motor
# parameters are constant.  The end includes a distance sensor pointed along the
# axis.
