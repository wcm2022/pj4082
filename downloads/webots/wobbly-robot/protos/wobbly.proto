#VRML_SIM R2020b utf8
# Two-wheeled differential-drive mobile robot with a low center of gravity.  The
# body is designed with enough ground clearance to tilt, but the low center of
# mass will wobble it back upright.  The body includes a mast with two distance
# sensors, a radio receiver and emitter, and a GPS receiver.  Each wheel has
# both a rotational motor and a position sensor. The shape is constructed
# entirely of primitive cylinders.
